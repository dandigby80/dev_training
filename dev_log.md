# Dev Log

## [18-04-2025] - Kickoff Entry

Today marks the official beginning of my development journey.

- Set up the 'dev_training' repository on GitHub.
- Created a clear folder structure for Python, Git and Terminal practice.
- Added my first Python mini-project: 'status_scanner.py' - a script that checks
if a website is online.
- Wrote and added a 'README.md' to describe the repo.
- Learned that Git doesn't track empty folders - a small hiccup, but now I know!
- Started terminal_basics.md file and commited initial skeleton
- Feeling motivated and ready to keep going.

** Current Focus:** Build confidence with basic Python, get comfortable with Git, and the command line and build a daily habit.

Next up: more terminal missions or another quick Python challenge.

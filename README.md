# Dev Training Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal development training repository where I document my learning journey across Python, Git, Linux, and more.

## 📂 Folder Breakdown

- **dev_log.md**: Ongoing journal of what I’ve learned, struggled with, and accomplished.

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of the year, I want to become job-ready and confident in my tech skills — strong enough that companies are looking for *me*.

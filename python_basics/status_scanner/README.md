# Site Status Checker

A simple Python tool to check if a website is online and measure its response
time.

## How it works

- Prompts the user to enter a website URL (with or without 'https://')
- Checks if the site is reachable
- Displays HTTP status and response time
- Keeps running until the user types 'exit'

Built as a beginner project to practice working with HTTP requests and 
handling user input.
